# Content Guide

TODO: Here should be a guide on how to write content, including

* language use (as simple as possible, so most people are able to understand it)
* Markdown help (Kramdown is a bit different than usual markdown)
* ERB usage
* general content structure, where to put assets, ...
* setting links (using the link helper, NOT actual links)
