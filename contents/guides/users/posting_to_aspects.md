title: When I post to an aspect, who sees it?
category: Dummy

If you make a limited post, it will only be visible to the people you have put in that aspect (or those aspects, if it is made to multiple aspects). Contacts you have that aren’t in the aspect have no way of seeing the post, unless you’ve made it public. Only public posts will ever be visible to anyone who you haven’t placed into one of your aspects.
