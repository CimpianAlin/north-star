You can write Ruby, JavaScript and template/styling markup with any editor, just use your favourite one that works best for you.

For developers who have contributed to a diaspora* project owned repository with at least two successfully merged pull requests, you can request an open source project license for RubyMine courtesy of JetBrains. Send your request for the license key - make sure to include details so that your contributions can be verified from commits. The license is valid for a year at a time.

If you use RubyMine, make sure to install the RuboCop plugin which will help you a lot to get the code styling right before pushing as a pull request.

If your are using Emacs, you can install rubocop-mode and flycheck for the same functionality.
