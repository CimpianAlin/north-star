title: Development Index
---

Welcome, traveler. This site should only ever be visible during development, as this is the default index site, shown when we do not know what we actually want to display. :) You are probably interested in looking at one of the following sections:

| URL segment              | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`/blog/`](/blog/)       | The project's blog.                                               |
| [`/guides/`](/guides/)   | Guides for users, podmins, and developers.                        |
| [`/install/`](/install/) | Installation guides for both production and development installs. |
| [`/site/`](/site/)       | Official project site.                                            |
